							<article class="review">
								<p>After Special Agent Odessa Hardwick is forced to kill her partner when he seemingly snaps, the FBI reassigns Agent Hardwick to desk duty pending investigation of the incident. Shocked over being forced to kill her partner, Hardwick cannot shake the feeling that something otherworldly has happened, as if her partner was possessed by something. Upon further investigation Hardwick finds that a series of similar incidents have occurred. People with no history of violent behavior suddenly go into mass killing sprees. Witnesses say that the perpetrators just snapped. Hardwick's reassignment takes her to former FBI agent Earl Solomon who has witnessed supernatural occurrences before. He advises her to reach out to Hugo Blackwood, an occult detective with a mysterious past.
								</p>

								<p>The latest novel created by Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan is a thriller with some great horror elements and action scenes, but the story ends up getting lost in exposition, and after finishing I was left a bit underwhelmed. I did not find the protagonist as interesting as the side characters, but the story makes up for that with vividly rendered action sequences, particularly scenes where the possessed victims are driven to random acts of violence. Those scenes gave me a sense that this was going to be an action-packed supernatural thriller, but the story gets lost in police procedural and exposition. It even touches on America's history of enslavement but sadly even that detail loses focus. Everything ties together in the end, but the end result feels a bit rushed with very little pay off. I feel that the authors were not sure where to take this story and tried to fit in as many elements as they could. The book serves as a decent introduction to a new series, but I hope that the next novel will be more balanced.
