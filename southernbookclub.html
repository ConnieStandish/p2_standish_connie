									<p>Don't let the title fool you! This is not just an adventurous romp about about a group of middle aged women overcoming impossible supernatural odds. This is a tale about a group women who band together to do what's right, not what's easy. Of course it has a dangerous vampire, but the real monster in this horror story is the patriarchy. Set in a Charleston suburb in the early 1990s, the story starts when Patricia Campbell, who gave up her nursing career after she got married, and a group of other women form a true crime book club. The meetings become means of escape for Patricia from her domestic, mundane life. Overtime she forms a close friendship with the other bookclub members. One day, a mysterious man moves into the neighborhood; James Harris has no past, no personal ties, and he constantly changes his story whenever he is asked about his background. In addition, shortly after James moved into the neighborhood both adults and children have either disappeared or died under mysterious circumstances. Patricia cannot shake the feeling that something is very off about him, but the more the charismatic bachelor ingratiates himself with the rest of the neighborhood, the more everyone (particularly her husband) dismisses her feelings as the wild imaginings of a bored housewife. When the vampire James begins to target Patricia's children, it is up to her and the rest of the bookclub members to stop him.
									</p>

									<p>I listened to the audiobook, and it was a lot of fun (the narrator did an excellent job). I would describe this story as a bit of an homage to true crime. The vampire is described as a sort of Ted Bundy character; someone who is so charismatic and charming that no one suspects that there's something off about him. Patricia Campbell often refers to the true crime books she has read to put the pieces together. This story also touches on how race, class, and gender come into play whenever there is a crisis. In short, society will often ignore or dismiss a person's account on an incident unless that person is a white male and from an affluent background. Lastly, this story is about a woman navigating a society that sees little to no value in her. Funny, scary, and quite gory; read or listen to it, you will not be disappointed.
